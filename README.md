# EC551 project

All modules are parameterized.
Image.zip is the VGA controller.


You must generate the IP CORES by yourself.  
The name of the ip core you generate should be the same with the one called in the module!!!!

There is a parameter definitions.vh file in the zip files. Almost all the parameters I called are from this file.

For instance, the parameter row_id_bits is the row ID number bit length.  Parametermult_out_bits is the bit length of the product of vector value and matrix value. matrix_val_bits and vec_val_bits are the bit lengths of one single matrix and vector element value.
